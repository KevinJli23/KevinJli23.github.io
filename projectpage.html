  <h3 style="padding-top: 25px;">Air Quality Reporter | Geocode, API, Data Retrieval</h3>

  <p>
    For the "Air Quality Reporter" project, I embarked on a mission to provide users with critical
    information about air quality in various locations. I engineered a sophisticated program that harnessed
    the power of APIs and geocoding to fetch air quality data from the Purple Air API and precise location
    data from the Nominatim API.
  </p>

  <p>Through meticulous data retrieval and analysis, the program effectively ranked sensor locations
    based on their air quality, presenting the information from worst to best. This user-friendly report
    empowered individuals to make informed decisions regarding their surroundings and take necessary
    precautions when needed. It was a fulfilling project, as it directly contributed to public awareness
    and safety.

  <h3>OCHIN HCC Gap Opportunities | Python, Pandas Library, Matplotlib Library, Excel</h3>

  <p>In the "OCHIN HCC Gap Opportunities" project, I delved into the intricate world of healthcare data,
    specifically focusing on Hierarchical Condition Categories (HCC). Armed with Python and supported by
    essential libraries such as Pandas and Matplotlib, I undertook an extensive analysis of HCC datasets.

  <p>The project was a collaborative effort with a dedicated team, where we meticulously analyzed the
    healthcare dataset encompassing a vast array of patients and medical conditions. Our goal was to identify
    opportunities for refining risk scores within the HCC framework. Through careful analysis and insightful
    visualization, we were able to present key findings to department leadership.</p>

  <p>Our findings not only shed light on gaps in the risk assessment system but also laid the groundwork
    for proactive patient outreach. By strategically organizing patient data and prioritizing HCC groups based
    on size, we were able to compile a targeted list of over 20,000 patients. This initiative directly
    contributed to improved patient care, aligning with our commitment to enhancing healthcare outcomes through
    data-driven insights. The project was a valuable experience that reinforced the importance of leveraging
    data to make a tangible difference in the healthcare landscape</p>
